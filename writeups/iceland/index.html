<strong>Please Note:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This page is no longer being maintained.  It was originally put up because
there was no information on Iceland available on the Web.  Shortly after
things changed dramatically, so this page degenerated into a collection of
links and had become far inferior to most other general Iceland sites, such
as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211233/http://www.iceland.org/"><b>iceland.org</b></a>, and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211233/http://www.nyherji.is/~gunnsi/gardar1.htm">Virtually 
Virtual Iceland</a>.  I'm leaving the brief history below, since this may
still be of some interest to somebody.

<h2>A Brief History</h2> <p>
Iceland was settled in 874 AD.  The first settler was Ingólfur 
Arnarson, who settled in Reykjavík.
Many of the early settlers of Iceland were small lords and kings from Norway
who were fleeing the tyrrany of Harald the Fairhaired who wanted to unify 
Norway under one king, namely himself.  Some of these early settlers were
great seafarers and in 982 one of them, Eiríkur Rauði discovered
Greenland (so named to attract settlers), and in the year 1000 his son
Leifur Heppni discovered the American continent which he named 
Vínland. </p><p>

Because of their flight from oppression the Icelandic settlers did not form
any central government for their new country.  They instead relied on a group
of equally powerful lords, the so-called <i>goðar</i> to regulate their
domains, and to regularly meet to solve major problems.  These meetings of 
the goðar were called <i>þing</i>s.</p><p>

In the year 930 the settlers established their central parliment or 
þing.  It was given the name <a href="http://www.althingi.is/">
<b>Alþing</b></a> which simply
means the central parliment.  The parliment still convenes today and is 
believed to be the world's oldest national assembly.  Up until 1798 the 
Alþing convened at <b>Þingvellir</b> which can be seen on
the picture above.  One of the major decisions to be made there was made in
the year 1000 when, after hearing both sides of the story, the Alþing
voted to adopt Christianity as the Icelandic religion. </p><p>

In 1262 a the number of people that had the status of goði had
been greatly reduced, and therefore each goði was far more powerful.
Then, in order to claim all control for himself, one of the <i>goði</i>s
made a pact with the Norwegian king, that gave the king limited influence in 
exchange for his support.  This was the end of Iceland's early independance 
and the beginning of nearly seven centuries of foreign control. </p><p>

Iceland was to begin with under the Norwegian king, then later on, because of
wars and coalitions in Scandinavia, in 1381 it fell under the Danish king.  
Under the rule of the Danish monarchy, Iceland suffered greatly.  In the
year 1550 Iceland was forced to disown Catholisism, which had been its 
Christian faith, and adopt Lutheranism, which, being a state religion, gave
the Danish monarch greater power.  Due to poor harvests, epidemics, the
 oppression of the Danish government, which enforced, among other things, a 
trade monopoly with Iceland, and volcanic eruptions, the greatest of which 
in the recorded history of mankind occurred in Iceland in 1783, the population
of Iceland in the year 1800 was only 38000, half of what it was in the year
1100. </p><p>

In the 19th century a long battle for independence was fought with 
the Danish government, mostly in the political arena of Copenhagen. 
Iceland's most prominent champion was 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211233/http://www.snerpa.is/kynn/j/jonsig/jonsig_e.html">Jón 
Sigurðsson</a>, a national
hero, who was both a statesman and a scholar.  Although Iceland kept 
gaining ground from the late 19th century, it was not until the 17th of 
June, 1944, that Iceland regained its full independence and established 
the current Republic of Iceland. </p><p>

Iceland is a modern welfare state, in the spirit of its Scandinavian 
neighbours and cousins.  Everybody reaps the benifits of free health care,
free education (from the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211233/http://www.est.is/~sjonni/Preschool/preschool.htm">preschool</a>
to the <a href="http://www.rhi.hi.is/">University</a> level), 
guaranteed pension and high
standards of living, while paying the price of a near 50% income tax.
Illiteracy, poverty, prostitution and violent crime are virtually unknown
in modern Iceland, and the nation is one of the wealthiest in the world, with
regard to its size.  The main industries are 
<a href="fishboat.jpg">fishing</a>,
<a href="horses.jpg">tourism</a>,
geo-thermal industries (e.g.
<a href="lagoon.jpg">Bláa lónið</a>)
and increasingly high-tech industries.
