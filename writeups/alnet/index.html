RECENTLY there has been a debate in Iceland about data transfer through the electricity distribution system, something that could be called a powerline network. This powerline network is supposed to make it possible for households and businesses to connect to the Internet in faster and cheaper ways than previously-available methods.
    <p>
      
The discussion has sorely lacked all facts, and this article is my effort to remedy that. There is only one small company, NORWEB in the UK, that is developing the networks being discussed. All the information in this article about these powerline networks has been obtained from NORWEB.
<p>

This particular powerline network is not in use anywhere in the world, with the exception of twelve computers in a school in Manchester, which were connected together by NORWEB for experimental purposes.
<p>

This powerline network technology connects computers together in a local area network (LAN), which cannot be larger than a small neighborhood (fewer than 200 computers), since connectivity is lost in neighborhood substations.
<p>

This powerline network cannot connect computers directly to the Internet. For this, an intermediary connection box is needed, which can, e.g. be placed in the neighborhood substation. This box must connect to the Internet via other means, e.g. via optical fiber. 
<p>

The bandwidth of this powerline network is shared among the connected computers, such that if more people connect, the service of other users deteriorates. Advertised transfer capacity is 1Mbs; therefore, if 20 computers are connected to the network, each computer may receive as little as 50kbs, which is less than fast modems offer today.
<p>

There are no modems for this powerline network in active production, as there are no standards for such a modem and no market exists (except perhaps in Iceland). Experience shows that modems only become cheap when the market has become large and there is a lot of competition for their production. We should therefore expect that the powerline network modems will be expensive and uncompetitive w.r.t. more common technologies.
<p>

As can be seen above, these powerline networks have various shortcomings. Apart from being completely experimental, they are neither fast nor cheap. 
<p>

It is strange how much fanfare has been created in the Icelandic media about an experimental network between twelve computers in a school in Manchester. However, the subject matter is a good one: how to improve Internet service to homes. For this, there exist many viable options:
<p>

One can use TV cables or microwave antennas to get data quickly from the Internet. That technology has already been in use around the world for several years. TV stations looking for customers could take a look at this option.
<p>

Many large telephone companies in North America now offer their users an ADSL service, but with ADSL technology it is possible to get a 1.5Mbs to 2.2Mbs connection to the Internet via normal telephone lines. Since each user has exclusive use of that bandwidth, an ADSL connection is at least 30 times faster than a standard modem connection. Since ADSL modems use a different frequency band than speech, the telephone can still be used concurrently with the Internet connection.
<p>

Fiber optic cables have been installed in about a quarter of households in Iceland in the so-called broadband system, at the cost of ISK 600 million. That connection will give these homes almost unlimited bandwidth to the Internet in the near future.
<p>

It is certain that homes and smaller businesses will soon have better access to the Internet. By adopting popular solutions, such as ADSL, Icelanders can benefit from the low prices that come with mass production and intense competition. In the long run, however, fiber-optic broadband is obviously the right solution, and it should be used as soon as optical modems are cheap enough. In comparison, powerline networks seem like a very unappealing option.
<p>

Once Icelanders have fast connections to the Internet, they can then start looking into another and a bigger problem: whether Iceland has a high-bandwidth enough connection to the Internet.
